Perfect 👍 this is exactly the kind of **realistic, complex SQL practice scenario** you need. Let me build it for you step by step in **detail**.

---

## 🎯 Scenario: **Organization–Course–User Management System**

You are the **Admin** of a platform where multiple organizations are registered.
Each organization runs **courses**, and those courses are managed by assigned **instructors** and **users** with different roles (Manager, Support Engineer, Instructor, etc.).

---

### 🔹 Entities (Tables You Will Need)

1. **Organizations**

   * Every organization has details like name, address, registration date, etc.
   * An **organization must have a Manager** (who is also a user in the system).

2. **Users**

   * Users can have roles like `Admin`, `Manager`, `Support Engineer`, `Instructor`, or `Student`.
   * Users are linked to an **organization** (except the global Admin who manages the system).

3. **Courses**

   * Courses belong to organizations.
   * A course has details like title, description, duration, and assigned instructor.
   * Each course can have **many students enrolled**.

4. **Enrollments**

   * Many-to-many relationship between **users (students)** and **courses**.
   * Keeps track of who is enrolled in which course.

---

### 🔹 Relationships

* One **organization** → Many **users**
* One **organization** → Many **courses**
* One **course** → One **instructor** (who is also a user)
* One **course** → Many **students** (via enrollments)
* One **organization** → One **manager** (special user role)

---

### 🔹 Sample Data Flow

1. **Admin adds an organization** → while adding, the admin selects an existing user as the **Manager** for that organization.
   Example: `Org1 = Microsoft`, Manager = `User: John (role=Manager)`

2. **Admin adds users** under organizations → roles may be Manager, Instructor, Support Engineer, Student.
   Example:

   * User1: Sarah (Instructor, Org1)
   * User2: Ali (Support Engineer, Org1)
   * User3: Ahmed (Student, Org1)

3. **Admin adds courses** → while adding a course, admin must select:

   * Which organization this course belongs to
   * Who is the **Instructor** (must be a user with role `Instructor`)

   Example:

   * Course1: `Database Systems`, Instructor: Sarah (Org1)

4. **Students enroll in courses** → they are linked via the **Enrollments** table.
   Example:

   * Ahmed (student) → Enrolled in Database Systems

### 🔹 Example Queries You Can Practice

Now from this scenario, you can write **complex SQL queries** to practice:

1. Get all organizations and their managers.
2. Get all courses under a specific organization along with their instructors.
3. Find all students enrolled in a specific course.
4. Count how many students are enrolled in each course.
5. Find all instructors who are teaching more than 2 courses.
6. Get a list of support engineers in each organization.
7. Find courses that have no students enrolled.
8. Update an instructor if a course changes.
9. Delete an organization and ensure all its users/courses/enrollments are also removed (**ON DELETE CASCADE practice**).
10. Create a view that shows `Organization → Course → Instructor → Total Students`.

👉 This is a **complex but practical admin scenario** where you’ll touch **constraints, foreign keys, indexes, views, subqueries, triggers** while practicing.

Do you want me to now **design the SQL schema (tables + relationships)** for this scenario so you can directly start practicing, or do you want to **first try designing it yourself** and then I’ll review?
